This is the first of 3 posts highlighting the fantastic achievements made by Uniti since Tilix made its angel investment  in the firm almost 2 years ago.

Uniti's innovative design ideas are getting a lot of attention and they are only just getting started. The firm started out two years ago the and are now weeks away from delivering the prototype. With a production facility in Landskrona coming online in November 2017, they **are on target to hit the ambitious target of going from a concept to putting a car on the road in 4 years.**

2 years ago, Tilix were so impressed by Uniti's ability to execute fund raising and to innovate at break neck speed, that it was not a difficult decision to become one of the first seed investors.

As Tilix works closely with Uniti to bring in more investors, we are taking a fresh look at what has sparked so much of an interest in this Swedish automotive startup.

> Rather than make the best cars in the world, Uniti's ambition is to make the best cars for the world.

Uniti strive to be super sustainable and energy efficient. In doing so they have questioned every aspect of the typical car design and transform that into fitting the needs of every driver in the most energy efficient way possible. This scales from a different approach to production, using less energy to design the car and using different materials and processes, therefore lessening the waste and pollution caused by the production process, especially in comparison to standard car manufacturers.

This ranges all the way from the larger parts of the car's outer shell, to the small details of software development where the software has been designed with the driver in mind so that the software will "feel like an extension of yourself". Uniti have opted to ~~switch materials such as iron to~~ make the body from carbon fibre rather than metal. ~~a more mechanically advanced material that is~~ This makes the vehicle significantly lighter ~~weight~~ and therefore more energy efficient as well as high performance. ~~An [EU whitepaper (2011)][1] discussing the the European transport area for the future stated that "the use of smaller, lighter and more specialised road passenger vehicles must be encouraged."~~ Uniti have taken every opportunity ~~on board every aspect of information~~ to make their EV as environmentally friendly as possible. The dry weight of Uniti will be 450kg, and will have significantly lower level of emissions of particulate matter, which is said to affect ["more people than any other pollutant"][2]. ~~This supports CEO Lewis Horne's statement that Uniti will bring "clean electric mobility in cities" and help provide a cleaner future for urban areas.~~

Designing their EV to be entirely recyclable and also using bio composite based materials, they have thought ahead for not just the next generation to come, but even the next century.

Uniti have described themselves as "an electric car company with big ambitions" and its not hard to see why - the entire car has been designed entirely from scratch, allowing them to create the car from an entirely new point of view, without having to take into consideration any [aspects of the other industry][3].

Cars have been the same for decades, but phones have undergone a huge development and have moved on from what they used to be. So why can't cars? It makes sense. As I learn the facts, am thinking twice about driving over-weight, internal combustion engined cars.

Autonomous vehicles are set to enhance driving safety. Sensors surrounding the car will be able to detect movement from afar. Uniti have utilised IoT to also not only add to the simplicity of the car, but by studying usage patterns of drivers, they have been able to identify what the driver wants, and edit those interactions of drivers with technology to create a seamless and safer driving experience. For example, there are absolutely no buttons within the car, but the car features a highly efficient information management system using voice recognition and one touchpad. The entire windscreen will feature as a head-up display, enhancing the safety of the driver by having all the optics on the dashboard for navigation and overlay. Other physical aspects of the car include an entirely new concept for the interior design. According to Uniti's research statistics, the average number of people per car-ride is 1.2 passengers, so Uniti have decided to make the car a two-seater, with the driver in the front whilst the passenger sits behind in the back.

Another extremely futuristic function of the car is the new steering concept, where two bars have been put in place of the standard steering wheel to create a smoother and easier, more natural style of driving. During the testing phase, they let all ages from infants to older citizens try out the steering system and sit in the interior of the car to discover which new concept was the most flawless and smooth running for the driver. Uniti believe that this steer-by-wire concept could "unlock a new era of intuitive driving" as well as create a more fun experience for the driver. However, standard steering will also be available for this who aren't yet comfortable with the idea of computer-assisted vehicle control. Read more in Uniti's digital brochure [This is what we do][4].

So when can you purchase one of these EVs, and when will you get it delivered by? Well Uniti have in fact already began taking orders, and are expecting the first deliveries of the EP1 to be taking place mid 2019. Uniti have proved to the world that their "clean, sustainable electric automotive" could be a real changing point in the future of smart energy, and help to make our cities a cleaner, less polluted place. Michael, the chairman of Uniti, sums up the goal of Uniti in his statement, "We aim to be the world's most resource efficient vehicle company". Is it time to turn electric? We believe so.
